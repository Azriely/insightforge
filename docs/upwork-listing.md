## FAQs for listing

**Q: How detailed are the reports?**
A: Each report is 1,500-3,000+ words with multiple sections, specific data points, and actionable recommendations. Think McKinsey-lite, not ChatGPT copy-paste.

**Q: What do you need from me?**
A: Just three things: (1) Company or product name, (2) Industry, (3) Your specific research question or focus area. The more specific your question, the more targeted the analysis.

**Q: Can you do multiple reports at once?**
A: Absolutely. I offer bundle pricing for multiple reports. Great for comparing different market opportunities or analyzing several competitors.

**Q: Is this AI-generated?**
A: I use advanced AI tools as part of my research process, combined with manual review and quality assurance. The output is professional-grade and far beyond what basic AI chatbots produce.
