## Proposal 1: General Market Research Request

**Target jobs:** "Need market research for [industry]", "Market analysis needed"

**Cover Letter:**

Hi there,

I saw your post about needing market research for [their industry/topic] — this is exactly what I do.

- Market sizing with TAM/SAM/SOM estimates
- 5-10 competitor breakdowns with positioning analysis
- Customer segmentation and buying behavior
- Strategic recommendations with short, medium, and long-term actions
- Key risks and mitigation strategies

My reports run 2,000-4,000 words and are formatted with clear sections, data points, and actionable insights — not generic filler. They're ready for boardrooms, pitch decks, or strategic planning sessions.

**Turnaround:** 24 hours from kickoff.

I've linked a sample Shopify e-commerce market analysis below so you can judge the quality:

## Proposal 2: Competitive Analysis / Competitor Research

**Target jobs:** "Competitive analysis needed", "Research our competitors", "Competitor pricing analysis"

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

Competitive intelligence is my specialty. For [their company/product], I'll put together a detailed competitive analysis that covers:

- Direct competitors (5-8) with detailed breakdowns of offerings, pricing, positioning
- Indirect competitors and emerging threats
- Competitive matrix comparing features, pricing, and market share
- Where your product wins and where gaps exist
- White space opportunities you can exploit
- Defensive strategies against competitive threats

Every data point comes with context. Every recommendation is specific and actionable.

I deliver within 24 hours. Here's a sample competitive analysis I did for Notion in the productivity software space: https://insightforge.azriel.io/report/rpt_1772426497_6224

What specific competitors are you most concerned about? That'll help me focus the analysis where it matters most.

Best,
Matthew

## Proposal 3: Startup / Pitch Deck Market Research

**Target jobs:** "Market research for pitch deck", "Need TAM/SAM/SOM", "Market sizing for investors"

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

I help startups build the market research sections investors actually want to see. For [their startup/idea], I can deliver:

**Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM):**
- Top-down estimate from industry reports and market data
- Bottom-up estimate from unit economics and customer math
- Reconciliation showing how both approaches align

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Who's in this space, what they've raised, what they charge
- How you're differentiated (positioning map)
- Market gaps and timing advantages

**Growth Projections:**
- Historical CAGR and projected growth for 3-5 years
- Growth drivers and potential inhibitors
- Revenue model benchmarks from comparable companies

I've done this for startups across EdTech, FinTech, HealthTech, and SaaS. Here's a sample market sizing analysis I did for an AI tutoring startup: https://insightforge.azriel.io/report/rpt_1772427945_2788

The output is structured and ready to drop into your deck's appendix or use for the "Market Opportunity" slides.

24-hour delivery. One revision included.

Best,
Matthew

## Proposal 4: SWOT Analysis

**Target jobs:** "SWOT analysis needed", "Strategic analysis for business plan", "Business assessment"

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

I can have a thorough SWOT analysis for [their company/project] ready within 24 hours.

My SWOT analyses go beyond the basic 2x2 grid:

- **8-12 items per quadrant** with detailed explanations (not just bullet points)
- **Cross-analysis matrix** — SO, WO, ST, and WT strategies showing how to leverage strengths against opportunities, shore up weaknesses, etc.
- **Priority actions** — ranked list of 5-7 immediate strategic moves based on the analysis
- **Probability and impact ratings** for each threat

Here's a sample SWOT I did for Beyond Meat in the plant-based food industry: https://insightforge.azriel.io/report/rpt_1772427922_9890

Quick question: is this SWOT for internal planning, for investors, or for a business plan? That helps me calibrate the depth and tone.

Best,
Matthew

## Proposal 5: Industry / Feasibility Research (Broader Scope)

**Target jobs:** "Industry analysis", "Feasibility study", "Should I enter this market?", "Research this business opportunity"

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

Great project — [brief comment showing you read their post, e.g., "the home healthcare tech space is definitely heating up"].

I can deliver a comprehensive analysis that answers your key questions. Depending on what you need most, I can focus the report on:

1. **Market opportunity**: Is this market big enough? What's the TAM and where is it headed?
2. **Competitive dynamics**: Who's already here and where are the gaps?
3. **Customer analysis**: Who buys this, what do they pay, and what drives their decisions?
4. **Entry strategy**: What's the best way in — pricing, positioning, go-to-market?

My standard deliverable is a 2,000-4,000 word report with structured sections, real data points, and concrete recommendations. Not the generic stuff you get from a Google search — actual analysis with strategic frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, PESTEL, etc.) applied.

Turnaround: 24 hours. I can also break this into phases if the scope is large.

Want to see a sample first? Happy to share one in your industry.

Best,
Matthew
