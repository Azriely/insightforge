## Template A: For "I need market research" jobs

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

I read your brief carefully — you need [specific thing they asked for, e.g., "a competitive analysis of the meal kit delivery market in the US"].

I specialize in exactly this. I deliver structured, data-driven market research reports with:

- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM) with both top-down and bottom-up estimates
- Competitive landscape with 5-10 competitor breakdowns
- SWOT analysis with cross-analysis matrix
- Actionable strategic recommendations (not generic fluff)

**What makes me different:** I deliver within 24 hours, not days. My reports are 1,500-3,000 words, formatted and ready for investor decks or board presentations.

I've attached a sample report so you can judge the quality yourself.

Happy to jump on a quick call if you'd like to discuss the scope.

**Budget:** [Match their budget, or propose $75-150 for a single report]
**Timeline:** 24 hours

- Strengths, weaknesses, and key differentiators for each competitor
- White space opportunities where you can win
- Strategic positioning recommendations

I can have this ready within 24 hours of starting. My reports are structured and presentation-ready — no fluff, all actionable insights.

## Template C: For "Help with investor pitch / business plan" jobs

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client name],

I can help strengthen your pitch with solid market data. I specialize in producing the market research sections that investors want to see:

- **Market Sizing**: TAM/SAM/SOM with clear methodology (both top-down and bottom-up)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Who else is in this space and how you're differentiated
- **Market Trends**: What's driving growth in your sector
- **Unit Economics Framework**: Revenue model validation

The output is a structured report you can drop directly into your pitch deck's appendix, or use to build the market opportunity slides.

I deliver within 24 hours, and include one revision if you need adjustments to the focus area.

Happy to discuss specifics.
