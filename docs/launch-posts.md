## 1. Reddit r/SideProject

**Title:** I built a tool that generates McKinsey-quality market research reports in 60 seconds

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've been working on InsightForge — an AI-powered platform that generates detailed market research and competitive analysis reports.

**The problem:** Founders and product managers need market research before making big decisions, but consulting firms charge $5-50K and take weeks. Freelancers on Upwork/Fiverr charge $50-200 and take days. Most people end up spending hours Googling and cobbling together info in a doc.

**What it does:** You give it a company name, industry, and research question. In about 60 seconds, it generates a structured 1,500-3,000 word report with:

- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive landscape with specific competitor breakdowns
- SWOT analysis with cross-analysis matrix
- Strategic recommendations
- Risk assessment

**Example output sections for a "Shopify AI tools" market sizing report:**
- Total Addressable Market: $4.2B globally
- 8 market segments analyzed
- Growth projections with CAGR
- Entry strategy recommendations

It's not meant to replace deep primary research, but it gives you 80% of what you need in 1% of the time.

**Currently in early access** — self-service launching soon. If you need a report right now, I'm doing them manually at cost while I build out payments.

Would love feedback on the concept. What kind of research do you wish you could get instantly?

## 2. Reddit r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** I replaced my $200/hr market research consultant with an AI tool I built

**Body:**

I used to pay a freelance consultant $200/hr to produce competitive analysis reports. They were good but took 3-5 days and cost $800-1,500 per report.

I built InsightForge to solve this for myself. It generates structured market research reports — competitive analysis, SWOT, market sizing, the works — in about 60 seconds.

**Honest assessment of quality:**
- It's not going to replace a McKinsey engagement
- But it's genuinely better than what most freelancers deliver on Upwork
- The reports are structured, specific, and actionable
- Perfect for quick market validation, pitch deck research, or evaluating new opportunities

**What I learned building it:**
1. The market for "good enough, fast" research is massive
2. Most founders don't need perfect data — they need directional insights quickly
3. AI is shockingly good at synthesizing market knowledge into structured analysis

If you're interested in trying it, the site is at https://insightforge.azriel.io — self-service launching soon, but I'm taking requests via email in the meantime.

What market research do you find yourself needing most often?

## 3. Reddit r/startups

**Title:** Show r/startups: InsightForge — AI market research reports in 60 seconds

**Body:**

**What it is:** An AI platform that generates detailed market research reports. Input your company, industry, and question — get a 1,500-3,000 word structured report with market sizing, competitive analysis, SWOT, and strategic recommendations.

**Why I built it:** I kept needing quick market research before making product decisions and couldn't justify $1K+ consulting fees every time. Now I can get directional insights in a minute.

**Stack:** Python/FastAPI, Claude API, Docker, self-hosted on my home server

**Business model:** $49/report (self-service, launching soon) and $75-150/report (done-for-you with manual QA)

**Honest take:** It won't replace deep primary research with customer interviews. But for secondary research, competitive intelligence, and market sizing, it's 80-90% as good as what you'd get from a freelancer, delivered in 60 seconds instead of 3 days.

Site: https://insightforge.azriel.io

Would love feedback from fellow founders. What would make this more useful for you?

## 5. Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I built an AI tool that generates McKinsey-quality market research reports in 60 seconds.

Cost per report: $0.01
Selling price: $49
Margin: 99.98%

Here's what I learned building it (thread)

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Founders need market research before big decisions.

Consulting firms: $5-50K, weeks
Freelancers: $50-200, days
Google + vibes: Free, unreliable

There had to be a middle ground.

**Tweet 3:**
So I built InsightForge.

You input: company name, industry, research question
You get: 1,500-3,000 word structured report

- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive analysis (5-10 competitors)
- SWOT with cross-analysis
- Strategic recommendations

In ~60 seconds.

**Tweet 4:**
The tech stack is dead simple:

- Python + FastAPI
- Claude API for analysis
- Docker on my home server
- Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS
- Total hosting cost: $0/month

**Tweet 5:**
Honest quality assessment:

- Better than 90% of Fiverr market research gigs
- Not replacing McKinsey (yet)
- Perfect for: pitch decks, market validation, opportunity assessment
- Reports are structured and specific, not generic AI slop

**Tweet 6:**
Unit economics are insane:

- Claude API cost: ~$0.01/report
- Infrastructure: $0 (self-hosted)
- Revenue per report: $49-150
- Gross margin: 99%+

If I sell just 3 reports/week, that's $600-1,800/month profit.

**Tweet 7:**
The site is live: https://insightforge.azriel.io

Self-service launching soon. DM me if you want a report now — doing early ones at a discount to get feedback.

What market would you want analyzed?
